#ABOUT THE PROJECT

Hi, I am Agbo Boniface Ebuka. 

What you see here is an answer to an assessment question for Php back-end developer's job given to me on 27-10-2020. 
The questions were not completely answered by me because of time.

This contains two functions which are "encryptor" and "decryptor".
The "decryptor" function will decrypt any encryted word(s) that is passed into it.
The "encryptor" function will encrypt any word(2) that is passed into it.

#Below is the assessment question

As a kid, I was fascinated about privacy and encryption. It led me to create my own
ciphered language. To encipher a word, I would apply the following rules for every
letter in a word:

● First, all letters are changed to lowercase

● The letter “ a ” will become “ e ”, and vice versa

● The letter “ o ” will become “ u ”, and vice versa

● The letter “ p ” will become “ b ”, and vice versa

● The letter “ t ” will become “ d ”, and vice versa

● The letter “ s ” will become “ c ”, and vice versa

● The letter “ j ” will become “ g ”, and vice versa

● The letter “ m ” will become “ n ”, and vice versa

● Every two consecutive letters that are the same , will become a single uppercase of that letter first, and then encrypted if necessary

Your task will be to write two functions in any language of your choice.
The first function will take a word or sentence as an argument, and return them in an
enciphered form, using the rules above.

The second function will take a ciphered word or sentence as an argument, and return
the deciphered form, using the rules above.
Examples
If we feed the following into your function “I am going to school”, it should output the
following “i en juimj du cshUl”. Other examples are as follows:

● Man = nem

● Pool = bOl

● Spoon = cbUm

● Elephant = alabhemd

● Adam = eten

● Lamp = lenb

● Hypertext Markup Language = hybardaxd nerkob lemjoeja

● Commitment = suNidnamd

● Success = coSaC


To be able to use this source code, just clone or download the repository and drop the files in your XAMPP or WAMPP directory 
and access it like this localhost/YourDirectory/cipher.php.

Thanks and Happy coding
